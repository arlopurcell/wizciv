The Plan

* make a thing where units can move around on a hex board
* make the camera move
* make the units fight
* implement AI
* limit sight range
* implement spells/mana
* create wizard towers
** regen more mana for friendly units
** eventually training
* create citizen (non-mage) units
* implement building wizard towers
** wizard towers have area of influence
** in AOI, regen is better
** citizens can work in structures
* other structures
** farm/mine (and other resource extactors)
** walls/forts
** traps?
* resource system (including food)



Spell Types - each has their own raw resource to be farmed
* Damage
** fire - damage over time
** ice - slow
** electric - chance for stun
** earth - ally healing?
** metal - higher damage
* Utility
** air - movement/blinking
** darkness? - stealth, backstab damage
** divination - detect stealth, increased line of sight, one-time see everything in range, long range scrying

Other things to study
* evocation - improves damaging spells
** line (increasing range)
** target one hex (increasing longer range)
** arc/circle around self (arc -> circle -> larger circle)
** enchanted weapons (melee only, increasing damage, maybe splash damage at higher levels)
* transmogrification - convert resources
* mana - increase mana regen/channelling, increase mana pool
* nature - improved resource extraction/farming
